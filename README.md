* http://www.chadvernon.com/blog/maya/compiling-maya-plug-ins-with-cmake/

# Build and run
The cmakelists are written so that it should be possible to run this project on Linux, Windows and OSX. (However, it has only been tested on OSX.) The default Maya version is set to 2016, and can be changed in FindMaya.cmake

OSX:

  Build:
    * Use CMAKE and store the binaries in a folder called build. "mkdir build"

  Compile:
    * in "/build" folder: "make"

 The plugin is created as "sampleplugin.bundle"
 In Maya, load the plugin using the plug-in manager.
 Run the plugin using any of the MEL scene scripts in the /scripts folder, using the script editor.
